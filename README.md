# GCOMP - a compression stack written from scratch

So far the compression stack plan is:

* Burrows-Wheeler Transform

* Move to Front Algorithm

* Run Length Encoding

* Adaptive Arithmetic Coding (with predictive modeling)

Currently getting about 55% compression ratios. The decompressor now works but is also quite slow.
